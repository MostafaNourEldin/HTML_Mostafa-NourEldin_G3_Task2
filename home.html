    <h2>About HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. HTML uses a set of tags and attributes to structure and present the content on a webpage. These tags define the structure and semantics of the elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and more. 

        HTML documents are composed of a series of elements enclosed in opening and closing tags. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag marks the end of the element. Elements can also contain attributes, which provide additional information about the element. </p>
