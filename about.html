    <h2>About CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS provides a way to control the appearance of web pages, including elements such as layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.

        With CSS, you can define styles for individual elements or apply styles to multiple elements at once. It allows you to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website.
        
        CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. This is done through selectors, which target specific elements or groups of elements on a web page. Once an element is selected, you can define various style properties for it, such as:
        
        - Colors: You can specify the foreground and background colors of an element.
        - Typography: You can control the font family, size, weight, and other text properties.
        - Layout: You can define the positioning, dimensions, and spacing of elements on a page.
        - Borders and backgrounds: You can add borders and background images to elements.
        - Transitions and animations: You can create smooth transitions and animations between different states of an element.
        - Responsive design: You can use CSS to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
        
        CSS uses a cascading nature, which means that multiple styles can be applied to the same element, and the final appearance is determined by the specificity and order of the styles. This allows you to create consistent and customized designs for your web pages.
        
        Here's an example of CSS code that changes the color and font size of all paragraph elements on a webpage:
        </p>
        <a href="contact.html">Go To Third Page</a>
       
    

    
</body>
